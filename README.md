## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
I mostly used w3school and StackOverflow for any questions that I had.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
One of the challenges I’ve encountered was understanding how classes worked with the html tags and customizing the tags with the css file. I was unfamiliar with how the buttons can change to have different effects. When the start and stop button can be hidden when the other is clicked I used w3schools to help understand how it was working. I didn’t know that classes could be added to element tags and actions could be a way to do that. I also noticed that element tags can have different ids and that the parent tag can change the children tag under them. 
I have more experience from a lower level programming language like C++ and functions need to be compiled in a certain order but not in javascript. I was worried about the functions being out of order. A quick lookup on StackOverflow helped me understand that javascript wasn’t the same as C++ in that aspect. It was challenging understanding the DOM for the tags and how the functions can manipulate the tags or classes so I used StackOverflow to understand it a bit more.


3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
For web development I want to know how backend servers can be used with web applications. How do the files into a web development project work together? I know the backend will hold the information that needs to be saved for the application but how can I tie that information to the javascript files? I would also like to know how javascript frameworks differ from each other and what makes them so useful. I noticed that more files can be added to the program and I wonder if by adding a lot of files it can make finding assets harder and if there's an easier way to keep them organized.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
If I had more time with this project, I would add certain features to give the user the option of adding more players or choose the difficulty of the game. Adding more players would let the user play with their friends locally and can help make the game replayable. To help distinguish between players, the background can change to a different color to indicate each player’s turn. By choosing the difficulty, players can start with the speed slow for easy and fast for hard. As the player matches patterns, the speed will continue to increase and make the game slightly harder each turn.
